# Unit 6 Programming Project

For this project, you will be writing three different classes: `Deck`, `Blackjack`, and `Yahtzee`. Make sure to properly JavaDoc your code and to use proper data encapsulation.

## PART A - `Deck.java`

In Unit 5, you figured out how to make a `Card`. A `Card` class has been provided for you in this project. In **PART A** you are going to use the `Card`s to create a `Deck`. A `Deck` contains 52 unique `Card`s. The potential values are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace]` and the potential suits are `[Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts]`. Your `Deck` class must include the following:

### PART A Required Methods

1. `public Deck()`: Default constructor. Creates 52 unique `Card`s based on the potential values and suits
2. `public int numLeft()`: Returns how many "undealt" cards are in `Deck`
3. `public Card deal()`: Takes a card off the "top" of the `Deck` and returns it.
4. `public void shuffle()`: Restores the `Deck` to "full" and randomizes the order of the `Card`s to be dealt

You may include any other `private` methods and instance variables you think applicable. You should have nothing else that is `public` than what is listed above.

## PART B - `Blackjack.java`

For **Part B** you are going to use your newly made `Deck` to play a basic version of the game `Blackjack`.

### Simplified Blackjack Gameplay

The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 points without going over. `[2-10]` are worth their face value as points, `[Jack, Queen, King]` are worth 10 points. To simplify the game, `[Ace]` is worth 11 points.

There are two *Players*, the *User* and the *Dealer*. Each are dealt two `Card`s, alternatiing with the *User* getting the first `Card` dealt.

If either *Player* scores 21 points in the opening hand, the game is over because they have scored a *Blackjack*. If both *Players* score a *Blackjack*, the game ends in a *Push* or tie.

If neither *Player* has *Blackjack*, then the *User* gets to choose to *Hit* or *Stay*. If they choose to *Hit* they are dealt another `Card` from the top of the `Deck`. If the new `Card` makes their points go over 21, they *Bust* and the game ends in their defeat. If they have 21 or less, they are prompted again to *Hit* or *Stay*. This continues until either the *User* *Bust*s or *Stay*s.

If the *User* *Stay*s, the *Dealer* now must *Hit* until their score is greater than or equal to 17, or they *Bust*. If they *Bust* the game is over and the *User* wins. Otherwise, if their score is 17 or higher, the `Card`s are flipped.

When the `Card`s are flipped, the *User* and the *Dealer*'s scores are compared. Whoever has the higher score wins. In the case of a tie, the game ends in a *Push*.

When the game ends, be sure to print the result *Blackjack*, *Bust*, *Win*, *Lose*, or *Push*. Then, prompt the *User* to play again. If they select yes, **do not** shuffle the `Deck` and start over. If not, thank them for their time and end the program. Only shuffle the `Deck` if the `Deck` runs out of `Card`s during gameplay.

### PART B Required Methods

1. `public Blackjack()`: This should instaniate any instance variables you have, especially your `Deck`. Don't forget, you are interacting with a *User* so you may need a `Scanner`.
2. `public void play()`: The method to be called to actually play a game. This is where you implement the flow of the **Gameplay**.
3. `public static int calcPoints(Card[] hand)`: This method takes an array of `Card`s and returns the amount of points that hand is worth.
4. `public static String determineResult(Card[] userHand, Card[] dealerHand)`: Returns a `String` in one of the following formats: `"User Wins"`, `"User Loses"`, or `"User Pushes"`. Does not alter parameters.
5. `public static boolean isBust(Card[] hand)`: returns    `true` if the hand is a *Bust*, `false` otherwise. Does not alter parameters.
6. `public static boolean isBlackjack(Card[] hand)`: returns `true` if the hand is a *Blackjack*, `false` otherwise. Does not alter parameters.
7. `public static boolean dealerKeepHitting(Card[] hand)`: return `true` if the dealer should keep hitting (score of hand is 16 or less), `false` otherwise.

You may include any other `private` methods and instance variables you think applicable. You should have nothing else that is `public` other than what is listed above.

## PART C - `Yahtzee.java`

In Unit 5, you figured out how to make a `Dice`. A `Dice` class has been provided for you in this project. In **PART C** you are going to create a simplified version of the dice game `Yahtzee`.

### Simplified Yahtzee Gameplay

`Yahtzee` is a `Dice` game that allows players to roll 5 six-sided `Dice` in order to try to make sets and/or runs. There are two *Players*: the *User* and the *Computer*. Each *Player* gets 5 turns. *Players* alternate turns with the *User* going first. After the 5 turns, display the total scores and who the winner is. Prompt the *User* to play again. If they decide to, clear the scores and start a new game. If they do not decide to, thank them for their time and end the program.

#### How a *User* turn works

The *User* rolls five separate `Dice`. The resutls are displayed. The *User* can choose any, or none, of the 5 `Dice` to re-roll. If none, the *User* scores. If the use selected `Dice` to re-roll, only the selected `Dice` are re-rolled. The *User* may then select once more to re-roll any or no `Dice`. The *User* then scores for the round.

#### How a *Computer* turn works

The *Computer* rolls five separate `Dice`. The *Computer* can then use any logic you choose for deciding how to use it's next two re-rolls. The *Computer* then scores for the round. If you are looking for a challenge, maximize the AI so that it regularly beats humans.

#### How scoring works

For our simplified version, a *Player* may have the following possible **scores**:

- **Pair**: The sum of any two matching `Dice`.
- **3 of a Kind**: The sum of any three matching `Dice`.
- **4 of a Kind**: The sum of any four matching `Dice`
- **Yahtzee**: The sum of any five matching `Dice`.
- **Mess**: The sum of all 5 `Dice` regardless of matching.

Once a **score** has been used, it cannot be used again for that game. To simplify your game, *Players* must take the largest possible match. For example, if I roll a **Yahtzee**, I must score it. On the next turn, if I roll another **Yathzee**, I cannot use that score toward a **4 of a Kind** or lower. I must either use my **Mess**, or if no **Mess** is available, I just lose the turn.

A **Mess* is automatically scored if either:

1. No matches are found
2. A match is found but that **score** has already been used

### Required Methods

1. `public Yahtzee()`: This should instaniate any instance variables you have, especially your array of five `Dice`. Don't forget, you are interacting with a *User* so you may need a `Scanner`.
2. `public void play()`: The method to be called to actually play a game. This is where you implement the flow of the **Gameplay**.
3. `public static int getScore(int[] scores)`: Given an array of scores, return the sum of those scores. Do not alter parameters.
4. `public static boolean beenUsed(int[] scores, int scoreIndex)`: Return `true` if the score in `scores[scoreIndex]` has been used (`0` represents an unused score).
5. `public static Dice[] rollDice(Dice[] dice, boolean[] toRoll)`: `dice` and `toRoll` are parallel arrays. Return a new array where the `Dice` in `dice` that correspond to `true` in `toRoll` were rolled, and those that correspond to `false` were not. Do not alter parameters.

You may include any other `private` methods and instance variables you think applicable. You should have nothing else that is `public` other than what is listed above.
